Hello &#x1F44B;

Great to see you again üëç. This week we are going to practice following elements of C++ üëá


## Kata this week

This week we are going to practice with various nueric types in C++. we will try to understand how much memory storage a numeric literal requiresvand what various `datatypes` C++ provides to stoe them.

### Numeric literals in C++
C++ defines following numeric literals:-
| Number | Type | Comment |
|:-----|:-----:|:-----------------:|
|10 |Integer |Numeric values without fractional part are integers. |
|-10|Integer|Integers can be positive or negative.|
|0.5|Floating Point|Numeric value with fractional part are floating point. These can be single precision or double precision values.|
|2.96E-2| Floating Point|Floating point values in exponential notation. 2.96 / 100 = 0.0296|
Numeric literals can be written in binary, decimal, hexadecimal and octal notation.

### Numeric types in C++

[Typed](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/03/31/how-typed-cpp-is-and-why-it-matters/) language like C++ has concept of datatype. Datatype helps in allocating bytes of  memory so that values can be stored in them. The **most commonly type** are presented in table below ( For much detailed description visit [Hints](#Hints-and-Study-Materials-to-solve-the-Katas) section ):-
| Data type  | Memory Usage|
|:-----|:-----:|:-----------------:|
|__int8|1 byte|
|__int16, short, unsigned short|2 bytes|
|float, __int32, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long|4 bytes.|
|double, __int64, long double, long long|8 bytes.|

# Sensai Says
**_"What you learn is not what you read or listened to, but rather what you attempted at..."_**
**[Progressive learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_education)** 


If you feel the exercise a little bit difficult to solve do not get disheartened. The whole idea behind these programming exercises is not to solve them but rather attempt them.

Try to attempt them in as many ways as possible, you will learn new techniques that will be very helpful to you in longer run especially in work field.

We will present you with **solution mail / document** also. The solution will show you various ways to solve a problem and why a technique is better than last one. 

We encourage you to make notes from the solution provided and try to apply what you have learnt in future exercise.

**What I will gain from these exercises ?**
1. Better and faster way to solve an exercise.
2. Reusable components like containers, algorithms etc. that you can apply to problem at handrather than designign your own.
3. Confidence and attitude to solve a problem in new ways, instead of trying monotonus techniques.
4. Writing the robust and quality software usign **[test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)**.

### All the best &#x1F91E;


##### _Still have some questions related to this exercise. 

>If you still have questions fell fee to connect. We will be happy to answer your questions.
