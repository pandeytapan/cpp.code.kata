# C++ code kata: Week #1

Hello &#x1F44B;

# Ground statement

Consider you as a data engineer. As a data engineer, your first task is to make vowel recognition dataset. For the exercise, you have to write `vowels_counter()` that will take a string and returns the total number of vowels in it. e.g. &#x1F447;

```C++
auto nCount = vowels_counter("abcde")
printf("%d", n Count)
2
```

# Surface #1

If you have completed **Ground Statement**, then for **surface # 1**  exercise you have to return the sum of the total number of vowels till it is a single digit. e.g. &#x1F447;

```C++
auto nCSum = vowels_counter("A cup of tea and coffee with sugar cube.")
printf("%d", n Count)
5
```

# Surface #2

To reach **surface # 2** you have to return the sum of the total number of vowels in each substring. "abba" will have substrings "a, ab, bb, ba, abb, bba, abba", and the number of vowels in each substring will be 1 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2 and the total number will be sum of all vowels presence e.g. &#x1F447; 

```C++
auto nCSum = vowels_counter("abba")
printf("%d", n Count)
7
```
