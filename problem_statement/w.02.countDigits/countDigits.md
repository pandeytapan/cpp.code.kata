# C++ code kata: Week #2



Hello &#x1F44B;

Your problem for this week is to write function named `orderedCounter`. You have to basically count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a array in order of appearance.
The function will take a string as the single argument and will return an array. e.g. 

```
nFrequency = orderedCounter("QuickSilver");
/* nFrequency will contain [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

**Level Up**
As the levelup you have to return an array of arrays with occurance of each letter in individual array. e.g.

```
nFrequency = orderedCounter("Banana");
/* nFrequency will contain [['B', 1], ['a', 3], ['n', 2]]
```
