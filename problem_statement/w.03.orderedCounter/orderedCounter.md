# C++ code kata: Week #3 `Ordered Alphabet Counter`

Hello &#x1F44B;

# Ground statement

Your problem :lock: for this week is to write function named `orderedCounter`. You have to basically count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a array in order of appearance :confused:.
The function will take a string as the single argument and will return an array. e.g. &#x1F447;

```
nFrequency = orderedCounter("QuickSilver");
/* nFrequency will contain [1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] */
```

# Surface #1

If you have completed **Core Statement**, then for **surface # 1**  you have to return an array of arrays with occurance of each letter in individual array. e.g. &#x1F447;

```
nFrequency = orderedCounter("Banana");
/* nFrequency will contain [['B', 1], ['a', 3], ['n', 2]] */
```
