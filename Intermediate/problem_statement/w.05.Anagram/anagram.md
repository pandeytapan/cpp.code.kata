An **[Anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)** is a rearrangement of words or sentences to produce a new word or sentence.

Fig. 1 Anagram of word _Listen_.

# Exercise

In today's exercise you have to write a function `is_anagram()` that will take **two strings** as arguments and returns if argument 1 is an anagram of argument 2.

The example below shows how we use `is_anagram()`:

```cpp
auto result = is_anagram("listen", "silent");
// result will contain
// true
```

# Rules

1. You have to pass two strings only.
2. Anagrams are case insensitive.
3. The return value will be either true or False.
4. You cannot use any library other than the C/ C++ standard library.

# Test Script

Test Script for this week's problem can be downloaded from **[here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!An6FDnpXbnZ80lSjWg-xHrABO022)**.

Try to solve the execise in as many ways as possible, you will learn new techniques that will be very helpful to you in the long run.

**What you will gain from these exercises ?**

1. A better and faster way to solve the exercise.
2. Reusable components like containers, algorithms etc. that you can apply to the problem at hand rather than designing your own.
3. Confidence and attitude to solve a problem in new ways, instead of trying monotonous techniques.
4. Writing the robust and quality software using **[test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)**.
