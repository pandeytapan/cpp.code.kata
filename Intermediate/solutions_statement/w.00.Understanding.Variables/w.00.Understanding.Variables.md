Hello &#x1F44B;

If you have not attempted üíª, I would request you to try your hand over few solutions, for those of you who have written soem solutions here is solution document &#x1F381; for you.


# Solutions  
## 01. Age of a Person

```CPP
01:     std::cout << "Age of a person: " << 78 << std::endl;
02:     std::cout << "Age of person: " << std::dec << 78 << std::endl;
03:     printf("Age of person: %u\n", 78);
04:     fprintf(stdout, "Age of person: %u\n", 78);
```

###` Solution 1: Commentry`

In our solutions we have written this statement in four ways let us discuss them one by one:-

We have used [`cout`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/cout/), which is object of ostream class and is associated with standard output device üñ•. 

Since this class is defined in [standard namespace](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/naming-conflicts-and-the-std-namespace/) we have to prefix `std::` before using cout. 

In first technique *see line 01* we have passed a [string literal](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/string_literal) followed by age of person. Since age will always be a numeric value and we are under assumption that it will be integral value we have written age as an [integer literal](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/integer_literal). 

Remember integers can be written in **binary, decimal, octal and headecimal number systems** in C/ C++. We have written here in deciaml number system. 

The [<<](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ostream/endl/) used here is basically overloaded operator of ostream class
