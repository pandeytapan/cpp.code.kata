let's go through the code line by line and explain what it does:

## The header files

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
```

- `string`: This header provides the `std::string` class, which is a sequence of characters that can be manipulated like an array. It is used in this code to store the user's name input.

- `iostream`: This header provides the input/output stream classes `std::cin` and `std::cout`, which are used in this code to read user input and display output to the console.

These headers are standard C++ headers and are included in most C++ programs that use strings and console input/output.

## Accepting name

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{

    string name;
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;

    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
```

This section of the code declares the necessary includes and the `main` function. It then declares a string variable `name` to store the user's name, and uses the `cout` object to prompt the user to enter their name. The `cin` object is used to read the user's input and store it in the `name` variable. The program then uses `cout` again to display a greeting message to the user with their name.

## Accepting integer values

```cpp
    // Accepting the integers and their summation here
    int first; // Memory location to store the integer value
    int second;
    int sum;

    cout << "Enter first integer:";
    cin >> first;

    cout << "You have entered first integer as " << first << endl;

    cout << "Enter second integer:";
    cin >> second;

    cout << "You have entered second integer as " << second << endl;

    cout << "Enter summation of the integers:";
    cin >> sum;

    cout << "You have entered summation equals " << sum << endl;
```

This section of the code declares three integer variables `first`, `second`, and `sum` to store the user's input. The program then prompts the user to enter the first integer using `cout` and reads the input with `cin`, storing the value in `first`. It then displays a message to confirm the input.

The program repeats the same process for the second integer, then for the sum of the two integers. For each input, it prompts the user with `cout`, reads the input with `cin`, and confirms the input with another message using `cout`.

# Comparison expresssion and branching

### The if statement

In programming, an `if` statement is a control structure that allows the program to make decisions based on whether a certain condition is true or false. The basic syntax of an `if` statement is as follows:

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // code to run if condition is true
} else {
    // code to run if condition is false
}
```

In this code block, the `condition` is an expression that is evaluated as either true or false. If the condition is true, the code in the first block is executed. If the condition is false, the code in the second block is executed instead.

### Using if statement in our case

```cpp
    // We need to compare the summation of the integers with the sum entered by the user

    if ( first + second == sum)
    {
        // truthy part
        cout << "Congrats! You've given correct answer";
    }
    else
    {
        // falsy part
        cout << "Oops! You need to do your Arithmetic classes again!!";
    }
```

This section of the code checks whether the sum of the two integers entered by the user is equal to the sum entered by the user. If they are equal, the program displays a congratulatory message with `cout`. If they are not equal, the program displays an error message with `cout`.

```cpp
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Finally, the program returns the exit status `EXIT_SUCCESS` to indicate that it ran successfully.

## Additional Notes

### What is `main ()` function

In C++, `main()` is a special function that serves as the entry point of a program. When a C++ program is executed, the operating system invokes the `main()` function to start the program.

The `main()` function must have a return type of `int`, which specifies the exit status of the program. When the program completes, it should return an exit status code to the operating system to indicate whether the program completed successfully or not.

### How to run the program we have written

To run a above written C++ program, let's say stored in a file called `lab01.v1.cpp`, you would need to compile the program first and then run the compiled executable file. Here's how you can do it on a Linux or macOS system using a terminal:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `lab01.v1.cpp` file is stored using the `cd` command.

```bash
$ cd path/to/program
```

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `g++`. You can specify the output file name using the `-o` option.
   
   ```bash
    $ g++ lab01.v1.cpp -o a.out
   ```

This command compiles the `lab01.v1.cpp` file and creates an executable file called `a.out` in the same directory.

3. Run the program by typing the name of the executable file followed by any command-line arguments, if required.

```bash
$ ./a.out
```
