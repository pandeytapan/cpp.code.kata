let's go through the code line by line and explain what it does:

## The header files

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;
```

- `iostream`: This header provides the basic input and output operations to and from the console. It defines the standard streams (cin, cout, cerr) and the extraction and insertion operators (>> and <<).

- `fstream`: This header provides classes to work with files. It defines the ifstream, ofstream and fstream classes for input, output, and both input and output file streams respectively.

- `iomanip`: This header provides the tools to manipulate the output of the stream using manipulators like setprecision, setw, left, right, and others. This header also provides the definition of some formatting constants like dec, hex, and oct.

The `using namespace std` line brings the entire std namespace into the current scope, making it easier to use the names defined in the above headers.

These headers are standard C++ headers and are included in most C++ programs that use strings and console input/output.

## Opening the file

```cpp
int main()
{
    ifstream infile("sampleRatings.txt");
    int16_t n32_rating, n32_count = 0, n32_total = 0;
    string userId, songId;
```

This is the `main` function. It creates an `ifstream` object named `infile` and opens the file `"sampleRatings.txt"` for reading. It also declares several variables to store the values read from the file, including the rating, the count of ratings, the total of all ratings, the userId and the songId.

## Reading from the file

```cpp
 while (infile >> userId >> songId >> n32_rating) 
 {
    if (n32_rating != 255) 
    { 
        // ignore ratings of 255
        n32_total += n32_rating;
        n32_count++;
    }
}
```

This while loop reads the values from the file, line by line. It reads the `userId`, the `songId`, and the `n32_rating` for each line. If the rating is not equal to `255`, it adds the rating to the total and increments the count of ratings.

### Closng the file and printing stats

```cpp
    infile.close();

    cout << "Total number of ratings: " << n32_count << endl;
    cout << "Total number of points: " << n32_total << endl;
    double f_average = (double)n32_total / n32_count;
    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << f_average << endl;

    return 0;
```

The `close()` method is called to close the file. Then, the code outputs the total number of ratings and the total number of points on the standard output. It also calculates the average rating by dividing the total points by the number of ratings, and then displays it on the standard output with a fixed decimal precision of 2 using the `setprecision()` function.

Finally, the `main` function returns `0`, indicating successful execution.

## Additional Notes

### What is `main ()` function

In C++, `main()` is a special function that serves as the entry point of a program. When a C++ program is executed, the operating system invokes the `main()` function to start the program.

The `main()` function must have a return type of `int`, which specifies the exit status of the program. When the program completes, it should return an exit status code to the operating system to indicate whether the program completed successfully or not.

### How to run the program we have written

To run a above written C++ program, let's say stored in a file called `lab05.v1.cpp`, you would need to compile the program first and then run the compiled executable file. Here's how you can do it on a Linux or macOS system using a terminal:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `lab05.v1.cpp` file is stored using the `cd` command.

```bash
$ cd path/to/program
```

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `g++`. You can specify the output file name using the `-o` option.
   
   ```bash
    $ g++ lab05.v1.cpp -o a.out
   ```

This command compiles the `lab05.v1.cpp` file and creates an executable file called `a.out` in the same directory.

3. Run the program by typing the name of the executable file followed by any command-line arguments, if required.

```bash
$ ./a.out
```
