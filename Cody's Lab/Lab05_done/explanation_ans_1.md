let's go through the code line by line and explain what it does:

## The header files

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for cout, cin
#include <fstream> // for file I/
using namespace std;
```

These lines include the necessary header files for input and output operations on the console and files, and bring all the names in the standard library into the current scope.

## Opening the file and writing to it

```cpp
int main()
{
    ofstream outfile; // create output file stream object
    outfile.open("numbers.txt"); // open file for output

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
    {
        outfile << i << endl; // write number to file
    }

    outfile.close(); // close file
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

These lines define the main function of the program, which creates an output file stream object named outfile and opens a file called `"numbers.txt"` for output. The program then uses a `for` loop to write the numbers `0` through `5` to the file using the `<<` operator and the `endl` manipulator. Finally, the program closes the file and returns a status code indicating successful termination.

In summary, this program writes the numbers `0` through `5` to a file named `"numbers.txt"` using an output file stream object, and terminates successfully.
